# Big Data

Big Data describes data-handling situations that are extremely challenging in terms of **Volume**, **Velocity**, or **Variety**.

* Big data **volume** means you handle thousands of terabytes.

* Big data **velocity** means you must store million of writes per second without holdups, or serve billions of read queries quickly.

* Data **variety** means that the data doesn’t have a strong structure, so it’s difficult to handle it using traditional relational databases.
