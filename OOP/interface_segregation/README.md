# The Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

The ISP states that we **should not create big interfaces**, but instead write a series of **smaller, more specific** interfaces that are implemented by the class.

Each interface would describe an independent grouping of behavior, allowing code to depend on a small interface that provides just the required behavior. Different classes could provide the implementation of these small interfaces, without having to implement additional unrelated functionality.

The following example demonstrates the `ISP` by grouping methods into more specific interfaces that describe a number of contracts that could be implemented individually by a simple printer or simple copier, as well as by a super printer that can do everything.

## ISP violated

```Typescript
// Typescript
interface Printer {
  copyDocument();
  printDocument(document: Document);
  stapleDocument(document: Document, tray: number);
}
```

## ISP enforced

``` Typescript
// Typescript
interface Printer {
  printDocument(document: Document);
}

interface Stapler {
  stapleDocument(document: Document, tray: number);
}

interface Copier {
  copyDocument();
}

class SimplePrinter implements Printer {
  printDocument(document: Document) {
    //...
  }
}

class SuperPrinter implements Printer, Stapler, Copier {
  printDocument(document: Document) {
    //...
  }

  copyDocument() {
    //...
  }

  stapleDocument(document: Document, tray: number) {
    //...
  }
}
```

When you follow the ISP, client code is not forced to depend on methods it doesnâ€™t intend to use. Large interfaces tend to encourage calling code that is organized in similar large chunks, whereas a series of small interfaces allows the client to implement small maintainable adapters to communicate with the interface.
