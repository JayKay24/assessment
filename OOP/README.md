# Object Oriented Programming

OOP allows concepts from the real world to be represented by code that contains both the data and related behavior.

The concepts are normally modelled as **classes**, with **properties** for the *data* and **methods** for the *behavior*, and the specific *instances* of these classes are called **objects**.

## SOLID Principles

Software Design is a heuristic process. It is not possible to create rules that can be followed like a checklist. The `SOLID` principles are guidelines to help you think about your program's design in terms of object orientation and can help you to make an informed design decision that works in your specific context. These principles also supply a shared language that can be used to discuss design with other programmers.

The five `SOLID` principles are:

1. [**Single Responsibility Principle**](./single_responsibility/README.md) - a class should have one, and only one reason to change.

2. [**Open-Closed Principle**](./open_closed/README.md) - it should be possible to extend the behavior of a class without modifying it.

3. [**Liskov substitution principle**](./liskov_substitution/README.md) — subclasses should be substitutable for their superclasses.

4. [**Interface segregation principle**](./interface_segregation/README.md) — many small, client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface.

5. [**Dependency inversion principle**](./dependency_inversion/README.md) — depends on abstractions, not concretions.
