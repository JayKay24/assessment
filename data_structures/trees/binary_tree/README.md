# Binary Tree

## A binary tree is a type of tree that has only two children nodes: left and right

* A binary tree always has a root node, which is initialized to null before any element is inserted

Pre-Order Traversal visits nodes in the following order: root(the current node), left, right.

### B-Tree

This is a generalization of a [Binary Search Tree](../binary_search_tree/README.md)

* Nodes may store more than one item and can have more than two children, making it efficient to operate data with big chunks.  B-Trees are commonly used in database systems.
