# Tree

A general tree data structure is composed of nodes with children nodes. It employs memory cells that do not need to be contiguous in physical memory to store objects.

* The first/top node is the **root node**; the only node that doesn't have a parent.
* A pointer from one node to another is called an **edge**
* Nodes that do not have any children are **leaf nodes**
* A trees **height** is the level of the deepest node in the tree.

## Variations of trees data structures:

1. [**Binary Tree**](./binary_tree/README.md)
2. [**Binary Search Tree**](./binary_search_tree/README.md) 

### Use cases

Trees are especially useful for hierarchical data e.g file directory structure.
