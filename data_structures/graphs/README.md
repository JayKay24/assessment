### Basic Graph Terminology and Concepts

* **Vertex** - The node from which graphs are formed. Its usually represented using a circle.
* **Edge** - The connection between nodes in a graph. It is the "line" between the vertices.
* **Degree of Vertex** - The number of edges on that vertex(node).
* **Weight** - The values on the edges. Can signify various things depending on the context.

Example of graphs:

* **Undirected Graph** - graphs that do not have a direction between vertices. The edge implies a mutual connection between the edges without a direction.
