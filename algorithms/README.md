There are numerous categories of algorithms including:

1. [**Sorting**](./sorting/README.md) algorithms - e.g [**mergesort**](./sorting/advanced/merge_sort/README.md)
2. [**Searching**](./searching/README.md) algorithms - e.g [**linear search**](./searching/linear_search/README.md)
3. [**Optimization**](./optimization/operations_research/README.md) algorithms - includes some practices in [**operations research**](./optimization/operations_research/README.md)
