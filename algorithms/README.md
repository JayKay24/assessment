# Algorithm

An algorithm in an unordered set of unambiguous, executable steps that defines a terminating process.

There are numerous categories of algorithms including:

1. **Sorting** algorithms - e.g [**mergesort**](./sorting/advanced/merge_sort/README.md)
2. **Searching** algorithms - e.g [**linear search**](./searching/linear_search/README.md)
3. **Optimization** algorithms - includes some practices in [**operations research**](./optimization/operations_research/README.md)
