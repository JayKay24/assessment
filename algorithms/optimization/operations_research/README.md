# Operations Research

Operations Research is a practice that involves defining an objective to maximize or minimize. It can help maximize objectives like yield, profit or performance; and minimize objectives like loss, risk or cost.

## History

During World War II, the British Army needed to make the best strategic decisions to optimize the impact of their operations. They created many analytical tools to figure out the best way to coordinate their military operations.

The practice was named **operations research**. It improved the British early warning radar system, and helped the United Kingdom better manage its manpower and resources.

 During the war, hundreds of Brits were involved in Operations Research. After, the new ideas were applied to optimize processes in businesses and industries.
