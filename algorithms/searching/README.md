# Searching

Refers to the task of looking for a specific element inside a data structure

When searching in an array, there are two main techniques depending on whether the array is sorted:

1. [**Linear Search**](./linear_search/README.md) - They are especially flexible because they can be used with both sorted and unsorted data.
2. [**Binary Search**](./binary_search/README.md) - Specifically used with sorted data.

**NOTE:** Linear search has a higher time complexity than Binary Search
