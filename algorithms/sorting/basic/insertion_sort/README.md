# Insertion sort

It works similarly to [**selection sort**](../selection_sort/README.md) by searching the array sequentially and moving the unsorted items into a sorted sublist on the left side of the array.

## Time Complexity O(n<sup>2</sup>)

Because of the nested for loop, insertion sort has a time complexity of O(n<sup>2</sup>).
