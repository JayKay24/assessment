# Selection sort

Selection sorting works by scanning the array for the smallest element and inserting it into the current position of the array. This algorithm is marginally better than [**bubble sort**](../bubble_sort/README.md)

## Time Complexity O(n<sup>2</sup>)

Because of the nested loop, selection sort has a time complexity of O(n<sup>2</sup>).
