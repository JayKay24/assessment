# Bubble Sort

This is the simplest sorting algorithm. It simply iterates over the entire array and swaps elements if one is bigger than the other.

## Time Complexity O(n<sup>2</sup>)

Bubble sort is the worst type of sort because it compares every pair possible. Because it uses nested loops, it has a time complexity of O(n<sup>2</sup>).
