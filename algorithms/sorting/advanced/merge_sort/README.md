# Mergesort

Mergesort works by dividing the array into subarrays until each array has one element. Then each array is concatenated(merged) in a sorted order.

## Time Complexity O(Log<sub>2</sub>n)

Because of the divide-and-conquer strategy, mergesort has a time complexity of O(log<sub>2</sub>n).
